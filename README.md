# Visualization of the GW190521 gravitational-wave signal

Numerical simulation of two black holes that inspiral and merge, emitting
gravitational waves. The black holes have large and nearly equal masses, with
one only 3% more massive than the other. The simulated gravitational wave signal
is consistent with the observation made by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave
detectors on May 21st, 2019 (GW190521).

## Details on the visualization

- The „apparent horizon“ of the black holes in the simulation (SXS:BBH:1006) are
  shown in black. At 0:10 the simulation finds an enveloping apparent horizon
  that signals the two black holes have merged.
- The gravitational radiation is translated to colors around the black holes.
  The colors transition from blue, representing weak radiation, to red,
  representing strong radiation. Specifically, the coloring represents the real
  part of the gravitational wave strain. The strain is computed from the
  simulation’s extrapolated waveform, which is shown at the bottom of the
  screen.
- Only the mass-ratio of the two black holes is relevant for the numerical
  simulation, not their total mass. The large total mass inferred for the black
  holes that produced the GW190521 signal only affects the conversion from
  simulation-time to real-time that is shown at the bottom of the screen. The
  movie shows approximately half of the observed inspiral duration reported for
  the GW190521 detection.
- The coloring on the horizons in the second movie represents the horizons'
  deformation. Specifically, it shows the two-dimensional Ricci scalar on the
  surface along with contour lines at 0 and 0.7 (black), as well as 0.891, 1.2
  and 1.5 (gray).
